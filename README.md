# Feed Reader Testing

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

## How to run application
1. you can clone or download the source repository from Github.
- In case you are cloning repository: go to the command line and enter:
git clone https://github.com/matejbolko/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game-master.git
- In case you are downloading repository, click on "download ZIP" or direct link: https://github.com/matejbolko/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game-master/archive/master.zip
2. Run the index.html in your browser (browser needs to support HTML5 Canvas and have enabled javascript)
